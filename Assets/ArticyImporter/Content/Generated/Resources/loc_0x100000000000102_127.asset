  - Name unknown
  - In the home of Mina Harker
  - Van Helsing visits Mina in her home to discuss the looming confrontation with
    Dracula
  - Oh my dear Mina, I really think it is too early for you to confront Dracula again.
    There is so much more I need to teach you.
  - Professor Van Helsing, it is touching how worried you are. However, time is not
    on our side here. If Dracula continues building a secure and covert foothold
    in London we might never get to him.
  - "You are of course right. I just wish we had more time. I am still plagued by
    the injury I received on the graveyard\u2026"
  - "\u2026where we put the ghoulish thing to rest that inhabited the body of poor
    Lucy."
  - "Never forget \u2013 it was not Lucy we encountered in this tomb. Lucy passed
    away days before. It was the evil seed Dracula left to sprout. But in the end
    we saved her soul. I just wished it would not have left me walking on crutches,
    for I cannot stand the thought of you facing this monster alone."
  - "Lord Godalming, Mr. Morris, and Dr. Seward are on their way to the Carpathians
    to cut off any possibility of retreat for Dracula. This leaves just us two here
    in London, and you are in no way fit to put yourself in danger. Don\u2019t worry,
    my friend, you have prepared me well."
  - Sweet Mina, my heart aches, but you speak reason beyond doubt. Let me hold you
    in my arms for a moment, before you make your way to the monster's lair.
  - Before I deal with you as is right and proper, do me the courtesy of telling
    me your name.
  - Don't talk to me about courtesy.
  - You are not deserving of any courtesy, Count Dracula. You have killed my dear
    husband, and my most beloved friend.
  - Do I not look familiar to you?
  - Look closely, Count. Is my face not familiar to you? If you were a gentleman,
    I might be offended. But you are not.
  - It's Mrs. Harker for the likes of you. Count Dracula, your hellish existence
    will end tonight.
  - Please spare me the charade. I know who - what you are. And I will have my revenge
    on you!
  - You have the nerve to creep in to my house like a common burglar?
  - You have me at a disadvantage, Madam. I do not know you, and clearly you must
    confuse me with someone else. I have never killed anyone.
  - I remember now - poor Mr. Harker carried a picture of you near his heart. You
    are Mina.
  - If it is true that you know and understand who I am, then you must also understand
    that your undertaking is preposterous and can only end with your own demise.
  - It will be your demise! I am not as unprepared as you might think. Professor
    Van Helsing sends his regards!
  - The mighty Dracula is fleeing from a mere woman? This was not the last you have
    seen of me. We shall meet again.
  - I don't think so.
  - Dracula speaking about courtesy? You are but a killer! You shall learn of my
    name, though now is not the time.
  - Wretched creature! You will no longer find safe haven in this city, my legion
    will come for you and sniff out your hiding place!
  - I told you that we would meet again.
  - I told you that we would meet again.
  - Oh my dear Mina, I really think it is too early for you to confront Dracula again.
    There is so much more I need to teach you.
  - Professor Van Helsing, it is touching how worried you are. However, time is not
    on our side here. If Dracula continues building a secure and covert foothold
    in London we might never get to him.
  - "You are of course right. I just wish we had more time. I am still plagued by
    the injury I received on the graveyard\u2026"
  - "\u2026where we put the ghoulish thing to rest that inhabited the body of poor

    my friend, you have prepared me well."
  - Sweet Mina, my heart aches, but you speak reason beyond doubt. Let me hold you
    in my arms for a moment, before you make your way to the monster's lair.
  - So you did, Miss Mina.
  - So you did, Miss Mina. Don't look so surprised, I told you I would find out who
    you are.
  - In the end it always comes down to sniff out a Judas and help them to their 30
    pieces of silver.
  - I don't believe a word you say. Wherever you got your information from, none
    of my friends betrayed me!
  - If you say so.
  - You spoke of courtesy last time we met,  so now do me the courtesy of answering 
    some questions I have for you.
  - It will be my pleasure. But I cannot guarantee that you will like what I have
    to say.
  - What do you want to know?
  - Why did you kill my husband?
  - Why did you have to kill my dear Jonathan? He travelled all the way just to help
    you.
  - Why did you come to London?
  - Why did you come to London of all places? What do you expect to find here?
  - That's all.
  - Actually, I cannot think of another question.
  - Are you ready to die?
  - 'There is only one question I need the answer to: Are you prepared to go to hell?'
  - You do not ask the lion why it kills the antelope. It is the natural order.
  - I have great plans for this city. I will shape it according to my vision.
  - As you wish. However, I am starting to grow bored by you. Time to end this.
  - After you beat my useful but pathetic pet Renfield,  I increased my efforts.
  - Renfield proved useful in discovering your identity.
  - As you couldn't even dispose of that pathetic creature, forgive me if I am not
    overly worried.
  - Keep gloating, pride comes before a fall.
  - Count Dracula
  - The villain of this story.
  - 'Count Dracula has grown tired of his castle in the remote Carpathian mountains.
    He enlisted the services of solicitor Jonathan Harker to purchase a residence
    in London. After killing Harker, he travelled to England by ship, lying in Transylvanian
    soil. '
  - Dracula's short term goal of coming to England was to be closer to society again.
    In the long run he plans to expand his power and establish a new monarchy of
    vampires.
  - Slender, well dressed in latest British fashion. Appears young when well fed,
    seems to grow older when not consuming blood on regular basis.
  - Mina Harker
  - The hero.
  - "Mina worked as a schoolteacher in London. After the death of her husband Jonathan
    and her best friend Lucy, she was forcefully thrown into the dark world of the
    supernatural. Dr. Seward introduced her to Professor Van Helsing, who helped
    her to understand the evil they were facing. Mina\u2019s meticulously kept journal
    and letters were instrumental in deciphering Dracula\u2019s plans."
  - Mina is still coping with the loss of Jonathan and Lucy. However, she is not
    consumed by a blind rage for revenge, she has come to a rational realization
    that others need to be saved from from suffering the same fate. She knows that
    they are facing a cunning and evil adversary, so she is biding her time and preparing
    and training for the final confrontation.
  - 'While still maintaining a lady-like appearance when in public, Mina prefers
    a more functional attire when out on a mission.  '
  - Van Helsing
  - The old, wise teacher.
  - 'Abraham Van Helsing is from the Netherlands. He is a polymath doctor, an expert
    in many fields. Philosopher and metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists
    of his day.  '
  - After the death of Jonathan Harker by the hands of Dracula, Van Helsing vowed
    to keep Mina safe from any harm. Not able to dissuade her from her path of revenge,
    he now trains her and tries to teach her everything he can about vampires.
  - 'His graying hair seems to be the only thing giving away his advanced age. His
    posture and poise are still that of a man in the prime of his years. '
  - Apple Girl
  - Girl who sells apples
  - Stake
  - 'The ultimate weapon against the creatures of the night. Carved from white oak
    and then blessed by a priest. '
